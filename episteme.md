Your being here implies your curiosity about these [epistemic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) markers. I guess all other metadata in each page is self explanatory. Date denotes the day when it was posted, tags categorize the data, status explains the current state of the post: whether finished, in progress, or a draft ^[In decreasing order of completeness.].

I have borrowed ^[or stolen if _you_ wish] this idea from [Gwern's belief tags](http://gwern.net) ^[who incidentally says that he stole the idea from [ Muflax’s "epistemic state"](http://muflax.com/episteme/) tags].

Since I plan to track my beliefs over a period of time, I think this is a pretty neat idea. This way I'll never need to throw away my content if I no longer believe it to be true and have changed my mind.^[After all [what are the odds a 6-year-old would know what a 30-year-old wants to do?"](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2366)] I do not wish to end up claiming that "I'm agnostic about everything."^[That's why I haven't given any leeway to myself in having a tag for probability near 50%, although I agree that there are some situations where you don't have any data to do any better.]

I plan to use following tags:^[Mostly similar to _Gwern's_, using ["Kesselman List of Estimative Words"](http://www.scip.org/files/Resources/Kesselman-Verbal-Probability-Expressions.pdf), page 71]

   -  **certain**: Everything on this page is correct as per my current knowledge. I fully endorse it and there are not many errors. If asked to assign a probability, I'll say `p > 85%`.

   -  **highly likely**: The point I was trying to make was fine but there are gaps in my reasoning and isn't so well put. I need to rewrite the post, so be careful. Probability `70% < p < 85%`

   -  **likely**: I found some idea interesting and managed to move over my laziness and _type_, to understand it better. I assign a medium high probability of `55% < p < 70%` to it being true.

   -  **not-believed**: To put it simply, it's **wrong** ^[I have clubbed together "unlikely", "highly unlikely", "remote", and "impossible" from Kesselman’s List]. I have changed my mind since I wrote the post. I'll try to note why, as an edit. Probability `p<40%`. 
   
   -  **fiction**: In general it's difficult to put. One could easily get into committing the [fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/). But fiction is an important part of my life. I have read my fair share of fiction and although I haven't written any, who knows I might write one some day. "Every author has some reason for writing the story or poem they do, but not even they always know whether it is an expression of their deepest fears, desires, history, or simply random thoughts." Don't base your views on these, please.

   -  **emotional**: These are much personal in nature. "cluster of ideas that got itself entangled with a complex emotional state, and I needed to externalize it to even look at it"

   -  **log**: These are just a log of events as they happened without my comments.
