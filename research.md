### MTBA: Matlab Toolbox for Biclustering Analysis
**Mentor:** [Prof. Nishchal K. Verma](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~nishchal/)
<div style="float:right">IIT Kanpur (Summer 2013)</div>

We developed a new Matlab^TM^ toolbox designed to perform a variety of biclustering algorithms under a common user interface, providing multiple functionalities for data handling, preprocessing, biclustering and visualization. More information is available on the [toolbox website](http://iitk.ac.in/iil/mtba/). 

### Feature Level Analysis

We took a case-study of acoustic and vibrational features from the different working states of an air compressor and graphically analyze them to derive the best feature set. We then validate our results by comparing the classification accuracy of the SVM model built by these feature sets with the standard PCA based SVM model, getting similar accuracies for both methods. This helped us to reduce the complexity of our earlier smartphone application while giving comparable results (see [publications](/publications)).

### Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition

We developed a Smart Phone application, to learn different fault states
of an industrial air compressor. The application was tested to recognize
the fault state in real time as the air compressor was running. It has
performed very well with classification accuracies above 93.73%. It is
believed that similar application and model with some minor changes in
specifications can be used for acoustic pattern recognition in wide
range of fields; even in industry.

The paper *Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition* has been
accepted for ICST 2012 (see [publications](/publications)).
