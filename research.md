## What have I worked on?

### PlanIt: Learning to Plan Paths from Large Scale Preference Feedback
**Mentor:** [Prof. Ashutosh Saxena](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asaxena/)
<div style="float:right">Cornell University (Summer 2014)</div>

- PlanIt make it easier for robots to factor in user preferences in path planning by allowing them to obtain these preferences on a large scale.
- Extended the existing cost function based 2-D navigation algorithm to work with high dimensional arm manipulation scenarios. Also worked on visualizing these learned costs as 3-D heatmaps.
- Integrated all these features into the online [PlanIt](http://planit.cs.cornell.edu/) system.
- Co-authored the paper which is under review in ICRA-2015.

### MTBA: Matlab Toolbox for Biclustering Analysis
**Mentor:** [Prof. Nishchal K. Verma](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~nishchal/)

- Objective was to allow a user to _compare biclustering results_ from different biclustering algorithms and choose the approach that best fits their particular scenario.
- Developed a new Matlab toolbox, MTBA, implementing a variety of _biclustering algorithms_ under a _common user interface_ while providing additional facilities for data preprocessing, visualization, and validation. 
- More information is available on the [toolbox website](http://iitk.ac.in/iil/mtba/). 
- Presented the work at _IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence, 2013_ (see [publications](/publications)).

### Feature Level Analysis
**Mentor:** [Prof. Nishchal K. Verma](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~nishchal/)
<div style="float:right">IIT Kanpur (Winter 2012)</div>

- Undertook a case study of _acoustic and vibrational features_ from different working states of an air compressor.
- Graphically analyzed these features to derive the best feature set.
- Built an _SVM model_ based upon these features and got comparable results to the standard PCA based SVM model, thus drastically reducing application complexity and training time.
- This allowed us to reduce implementation costs of condition based monitoring system via use of consumer-grade electronics.
- Presented the work at _IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence, 2013_ (see [publications](/publications)).

### Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition

**Mentor:** [Prof. Nishchal K. Verma](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~nishchal/)
<div style="float:right">IIT Kanpur (Summer 2012)</div>

- Developed a smart phone application, to _learn different fault states_ of an industrial air compressor using _acoustic pattern recognition_.
- Tested the application to recognize the fault state in real time as the air compressor was running. It has performed very well with classification accuracies above 90\%.
- The paper *Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition* was accepted for ICST 2012 (see [publications](/publications)).
