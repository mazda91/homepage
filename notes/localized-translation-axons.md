title: Role of Localized Translation in Axons

What follows are the notes for various papers I am reading for the Neurobiology course.

Before we start anything, _translation_ here refers to the final step from DNA to protein where [mRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA) is decoded by ribosome to produce protein. [^aside]

Probably useful to know a little about [Axon guidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon_guidance). Basically growing axons have [growth cones]() at their growing tip which can respond to extracellular environmental signals, called _guidance cues_.

Few important molecules:

- _Netrins_: attract or repel
- _Slits_: repel
- _Ephrins_: attract or repel
- _Semaphorines_: repel

Ca^2+^ probably plays a very important role in all this.

This phenomenon was initially thought to be just a development characteristic, observed in vitro models. Interestingly, this has now been observed in adults especially during nerve regeneration.

[^aside]: I was confused for quite some time actually. Not being a biology major, first thing that comes into mind is language translation and second is moving an object from one place to another. After reading the first page of the paper I realized that they are talking about protein translation. Probably my bone-headedness than anything.

## Evidence

- Axon responds to 'Guidance cues' even when isolated from the cell body.
- Very quick [growth cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_cone) response to guidance cues
- Asymmetric growth or reduction according to attraction or repulsion which are not mirror-symmetrical.

## How?

- Quite puzzling actually.
    - Growth cones are far from Golgi apparatus.
    - There are no membrane bound ribosomes or Golgi stacks.
    - But there are ribosomes and Smooth [ER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoplasmic_reticulum) there.

- Hypothesis
    - Cues activate translation initiation i.e. 'open gates'.
    - mRNA specific regulation
    - microRNA: protein selection.
    - If Ca^2+^ release:
        - small: repulsion
        - moderate: attraction
      i.e. Ca^+2^ acts as a switch.
    - Not all rely on Ca^2+^ though.

## Why?

### Macromolecular crowding and protein turnover

- 20-30% of the volume of the cell is occupied by macromolecules. Crowding by these **slows diffusion** and **alters reaction rates** unacceptebly.
- Protein degradation also important.
- Hence more efficient to store mRNA.

### RNA flexibility

- More flexible because arbitrary mRNA translation can take place to regulate protein activity.
- Alternate splicing can create mRNA with different regulatory sequence.

### Decentralization

- Growth cones are far from the cell body and some protein may not survive the journey.

### Axonal fate

- _Fate_: Polarity in differentiated cell.
- Localize translational factors → Determine daughter cell fate.

### 'Microdomains' and asymmetry

- Regulate "site of translation".
    - Asymmetrical translation
    - Directional turning, **NOT** elongation.
- _Ca^2+^ Microdomains_: Cluster of Ca^2+^ channels.    
- Ca^2+^ microdomains probably important for regulation.

### Distinct Nascent Protein properties

- Proteins free of post-translation modifications.
    - Unclear why not just remove these modifications than create new.
- Proteins free of oxidative damage.
    - But these are not used for elongation. Elongation proteins coming from the soma ^[Main cell body of the neuron.] are fresh enough.
- Function as _Chaperones_ to support proper folding.
