Lempel-Ziv's universal coding schemes are probably the most often used in practical compression algorithms. Their sliding window algorithm was first described in their 1977 paper ["A Universal Algorithm for Sequential Data Compression"](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring03/cps296.5/papers/ziv_lempel_1977_universal_algorithm.pdf). Its optimality was proven in 1994 by [Weiner and Ziv](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~zzhao/ece563/handouts/LZ71.pdf).

# How it works?

Given a string to be encoded:


1. We fix a window size $w$ and also a maximum length $l_{max}$. As an example we take $w=4$.
2. Next we parse the source sequence. We consider the $w$-length window before the current position and try to find the longest match of any sequence starting in the window. This match is identical to the sequence starting on the current position.



3. If there exists such a match, the encoder gets the **starting position** of this match in the window as well as the **length** of this match. Here in the example above they are 3 and 5 respectively. We then move forward the current window by this match length. (For practicality, matching is stopped after $l_{max}$ length is achieved.)
