# My Clippings

These are random highlights from books I've been reading. Using fmap's [clippings](https://github.com/fmap/clippings) library I wrote a small tool [clippings2md](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/clippings2md) to convert my Paperwhite's clippings to markdown and export that here.

> something, for instance, to carry in their pockets, so when they are
> far away from each other, and pine for a sound of 'that beloved
> voice,' they will have only to take up this electrical apparatus, put
> it to their ears, and be happy. Ah! blissful lovers of the future!"

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> A powerful and compelling strain of mysticism runs like branching
> mycelia through the mycological literature, where I encountered one
> incredible speculation after another: that the mycelia of fungi are
> literally neurons, together comprising an organ of terrestrial
> intelligence and communication (Paul Stamets); that the ingestion of
> hallucinogenic mushrooms by the higher primates spurred the rapid
> evolution of the human brain (Terence McKenna); that the
> hallucinogenic mushrooms ingested by early man inspired the shamanic
> visions that led to the birth of religion (Gordon Wasson); that the
> ritual ingestion of a hallucinogenic fungus—called ergot—by Greek
> thinkers (including Plato) at Eleusis is responsible for some of the
> greatest achievements of Greek culture, including Platonic philosophy
> (Wasson again); that wild mushrooms in the diet, by nourishing the
> human unconscious with lunar energy, “stimulate imagination and
> intuition” (Andrew Weil).

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> began scribbling objections in the margin. But humans differ from
> animals in morally significant ways. Yes they do, Singer readily
> acknowledges, which is why we shouldn’t treat pigs and children alike.
> Equal consideration of interests is not the same as equal treatment,
> he points out; children have an interest in being educated, pigs in
> rooting around in the dirt. But where their interests are the same,
> the principle of equality demands they receive the same consideration.
> And the one all-important interest humans share with pigs, as with all
> sentient creatures, is an interest in avoiding pain.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> I wasn’t at it long enough for slaughtering chickens to become
> routine, but the work did begin to feel mechanical, and that feeling,
> perhaps more than any other, was disconcerting: how quickly you can

> nothing of it. In a way, the most morally troubling thing about
> killing chickens is that after a while it is no longer morally

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> For some reason the image that stuck with me from that day was that
> slender blade of grass in a too-big, wind-whipped pasture, burning all
> those calories just to stand up straight and keep its chloroplasts
> aimed at the sun. I’d always thought of the trees and grasses as
> antagonists—another zero-sum deal in which the gain of the one entails
> the loss of the other. To a point, this is true: More grass means less
> forest; more forest less grass. But either-or is a construction more
> deeply woven into our culture than into nature, where even antagonists
> depend on one another and the liveliest places are the edges, the
> in-betweens or both-ands. So it is with the blade of grass and the
> adjacent forest as, indeed, with all the species sharing this most
> complicated farm. Relations are what matter most, and the health of
> the cultivated turns on the health of the wild. Before I came to
> Polyface I’d read a sentence of Joel’s that in its diction had struck
> me as an awkward hybrid of the economic and the spiritual. I could see
> now how characteristic that mixing is, and that perhaps the sentence
> isn’t so awkward after all: “One of the greatest assets of a farm is
> the sheer ecstasy of life.”

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> “Me and the folks who buy my food are like the Indians—we just want to
> opt out. That’s all the Indians ever wanted—to keep their tepees, to
> give their kids herbs instead of patent medicines and leeches. They
> didn’t care if there was a Washington, D.C., or a Custer or a USDA;
> just leave us alone. But the Western mind can’t bear an opt-out
> option. We’re going to have to refight the Battle of the Little
> Bighorn to preserve the right to opt out, or your grandchildren and
> mine will have no choice but to eat amalgamated, irradiated,
> genetically prostituted, bar-coded, adulterated fecal spam from the
> centralized processing conglomerate.”

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> “You know what the best kind of organic certification would be? Make
> an unannounced visit to a farm and take a good long look at the
> farmer’s bookshelf. Because what you’re feeding your emotions and
> thoughts is what this is really all about. The way I produce a chicken
> is an extension of my worldview. You can learn more about that by
> seeing what’s sitting on my bookshelf than having me fill out a whole
> bunch of forms.”

 --- Michael Pollan

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> The second phase of the marriage of grasses and humans is usually
> called the “invention of agriculture,” a self-congratulatory phrase
> that overlooks the role of the grasses themselves in revising the
> terms of the relationship. Beginning about ten thousand years ago a
> handful of particularly opportunistic grass species—the ancestors of
> wheat, rice, and corn—evolved to produce tremendous, nutritionally
> dense seeds that could nourish humans directly, thereby cutting out
> the intermediary animals. The grasses accomplished this feat by
> becoming annuals, throwing all their energy into making seeds rather
> than storing some of it underground in roots and rhizomes to get
> through the winter. These monster annual grasses outcompeted not only
> the trees, which humans obligingly cut down to expand the annuals’
> habitats, but bested the perennial grasses, which in most places
> succumbed to the plow. Their human sponsors ripped up the great
> perennial-polyculture grasslands to make the earth safe for annuals,
> which would henceforth be grown in strict monocultures.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> Dawson and his colleague Stefania Mambelli prepared an analysis
> showing roughly how much of the carbon in the various McDonald’s menu
> items came from corn, and plotted them on a graph. The sodas came out
> at the top, not surprising since they consist of little else than corn
> sweetener, but virtually everything else we ate revealed a high
> proportion of corn, too. In order of diminishing corniness, this is
> how the laboratory measured our meal: soda (100 percent corn), milk
> shake (78 percent), salad dressing (65 percent), chicken nuggets (56
> percent), cheeseburger (52 percent), and French fries (23 percent).
> What in the eyes of the omnivore looks like a meal of impressive
> variety turns out, when viewed through the eyes of the mass
> spectrometer, to be the meal of a far more specialized kind of eater.
> But then, this is what the industrial eater has become: corn’s koala.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> Corn, a species that had been a modest beneficiary of the first two
> ages of food processing (having taken well to the can and the
> freezer), really came into its own during the third. You would never
> know it without reading the ingredient label (a literary genre unknown
> until the third age), but corn is the key constituent of all four of
> these processed foods. Along with the soybean, its rotational partner
> in the field, corn has done more than any other species to help the
> food industry realize the dream of freeing food from nature’s
> limitations and seducing the omnivore into eating more of a single
> plant than anyone would ever have thought possible.

> oil per acre of corn. (Some estimates are much higher.) Put another
> way, it takes more than a calorie of fossil fuel energy to produce a
> calorie of food; before the advent of chemical fertilizer the Naylor

> of energy invested. From the standpoint of industrial efficiency, it’s
> too bad we can’t simply drink the petroleum directly.

 --- Michael Pollan

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> The great turning point in the modern history of corn, which in turn
> marks a key turning point in the industrialization of our food, can be
> dated with some precision to the day in 1947 when the huge munitions
> plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, switched over to making chemical

> tremendous surplus of ammonium nitrate, the principal ingredient in

> The chemical fertilizer industry (along with that of pesticides, which

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> Planting the old open-pollinated (nonhybrid) varieties so densely
> would result in stalks grown spindly as they jostled each other for
> sunlight; eventually the plants would topple in the wind. Hybrids have
> been bred for thicker stalks and stronger root systems, the better to

> Basically, modern hybrids can tolerate the corn equivalent of city

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> It is, for a grass, a bizarre arrangement with crucial implications:
> The ear’s central location halfway down the stalk allows it to capture
> far more nutrients than it would up top, so suddenly producing
> hundreds of gigantic seeds becomes metabolically feasible. Yet because
> those seeds are now trapped in a tough husk, the plant has lost its
> ability to reproduce itself—hence the catastrophe in teosinte’s sex
> change. A mutation this freakish and maladaptive would have swiftly
> brought the plant to an evolutionary dead end had one of these freaks
> not happened to catch the eye of a human somewhere in Central America
> who, looking for something to eat, peeled open the husk to free the
> seeds. What would have been an unheralded botanical catastrophe in a
> world without humans became an incalculable evolutionary boon. If you
> look hard enough, you can still find teosinte growing in certain
> Central American highlands; you can find maize, its mutant offspring,
> anywhere you find people.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> The dual identity also made corn indispensable to the slave trade:
> Corn was both the currency traders used to pay for slaves in Africa
> and the food upon which slaves subsisted during their passage to
> America. Corn is the protocapitalist plant.

 --- Michael Pollan

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> “When you look at the isotope ratios,” Todd Dawson, a Berkeley
> biologist who’s done this sort of research, told me, “we North
> Americans look like corn chips with legs.” Compared to us, Mexicans
> today consume a far more varied carbon diet: the animals they eat
> still eat grass (until recently, Mexicans regarded feeding corn to
> livestock as a sacrilege); much of their protein comes from legumes;
> and they still sweeten their beverages with cane sugar. So that’s us:
> processed corn, walking.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma

> Where most plants during photosynthesis create compounds that have

> The C-4 trick represents an important economy for a plant, giving it
> an advantage, especially in areas where water is scarce and
> temperatures high. In order to gather carbon atoms from the air, a
> plant has to open its stomata, the microscopic orifices in the leaves
> through which plants both take in and exhaust gases. Every time a
> stoma opens to admit carbon dioxide precious molecules of water
> escape. It’s as though every time you opened your mouth to eat you
> lost a quantity of blood. Ideally, you would open your mouth as seldom
> as possible, ingesting as much food as you could with every bite. This
> is essentially what a C-4 plant does. By recruiting extra atoms of
> carbon during each instance of photosynthesis, the corn plant is able
> to limit its loss of water and “fix”—that is, take from the atmosphere
