description: Clippings from what I've been reading.

These are random highlights from books I've been reading. Using fmap's [clippings](https://github.com/fmap/clippings) library I wrote a small tool [clippings2md](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/clippings2md) to convert my Paperwhite's clippings to markdown and export that here.

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> The moral is significant: when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will
> believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe,
> System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is
> sometimes busy, and often lazy. Indeed, there is evidence that people
> are more likely to be influenced by empty persuasive messages, such as
> commercials, when they are tired and depleted.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> Only one interpretation came to mind, and you were never aware of the
> ambiguity. System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it
> rejects, or even of the fact that there were alternatives. Conscious
> doubt is not in the repertoire of System 1; it requires maintaining
> incompatible interpretations in mind at the same time, which demands
> mental effort. Uncertainty and doubt are the domain of System 2.

> The great comedian Danny Kaye had a line that has stayed with me since

> to conclusions.”

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> The psychologist Paul Bloom, writing in The Atlantic in 2005,
> presented the provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate
> physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of
> religious beliefs. He observes that “we perceive the world of objects
> as essentially separate from the world of minds, making it possible
> for us to envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls.” The two modes
> of causation that we are set to perceive make it natural for us to
> accept the two central beliefs of many religions: an immaterial
> divinity is the ultimate cause of the physical world, and immortal
> souls temporarily control our bodies while we live and leave them
> behind as we die. In Bloom’s view, the two concepts of causality were
> shaped separately by evolutionary forces, building the origins of
> religion into the structure of System 1.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> Michotte had a different idea: he argued that we see causality, just
> as directly as we see color. To make his point, he created episodes in
> which a black square drawn on paper is seen in motion; it comes into
> contact with another square, which immediately begins to move. The
> observers know that there is no real physical contact, but they
> nevertheless have a powerful “illusion of causality.” If the second
> object starts moving instantly, they describe it as having been
> “launched” by the first.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its
> relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They
> allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe
> from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of
> social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social
> organization and cohesion—the basic sources of psychological and
> social stability.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> What psychologists do believe is that all of us live much of our life
> guided by the impressions of System 1—and we often do not know the
> source of these impressions. How do you know that a statement is true?
> If it is strongly linked by logic or association to other beliefs or
> preferences you hold, or comes from a source you trust and like, you
> will feel a sense of cognitive ease. The trouble is that there may be
> other causes for your feeling of ease—including the quality of the
> font and the appealing rhythm of the prose—and you have no simple way
> of tracing your feelings to their source.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> Anything that makes it easier for the associative machine to run
> smoothly will also bias beliefs. A reliable way to make people believe
> in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not
> easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and
> marketers have always known this fact. But it was psychologists who
> discovered that you do not have to repeat the entire statement of a
> fact or idea to make it appear true.

 --- Kahneman, Daniel

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

> The “Florida effect” involves two stages of priming. First, the set of
> words primes thoughts of old age, though the word old is never
> mentioned; second, these thoughts prime a behavior, walking slowly,

### The Atrocity Archives

> I am compelled to admit that there is a difference between the
> function and purpose of horror and spy fiction. Horror fiction allows

> but the threat verges on the overwhelming and may indeed carry the

> The next rule is MAKE STATEMENTS. This is a positive way of saying
> “Don’t ask questions all the time.” If we’re in a scene and I say,
> “Who are you? Where are we? What are we doing here? What’s in that

> worked with that person. That person is a drag. It’s usually the same
> person around the office who says things like “There’s no calories in
> it if you eat it standing up!” and “I felt menaced when Terry raised

### Bossypants

> The second rule of improvisation is not only to say yes, but YES, AND.
> You are supposed to agree and then add something of your own. If I
> start a scene with “I can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you just
> say, “Yeah…” we’re kind of at a standstill. But if I say, “I can’t
> believe it’s so hot in here,” and you say, “What did you expect? We’re

> say, “Yes, this can’t be good for the wax figures.” Or if I say, “I
> can’t believe it’s so hot in here,” and you say, “I told you we
> shouldn’t have crawled into this dog’s mouth,” now we’re getting
> somewhere. To me YES, AND means don’t be afraid to contribute. It’s
> your responsibility to contribute. Always make sure you’re adding
> something to the discussion. Your initiations are worthwhile.

 --- Tina Fey

### Bossypants

> The first rule of improvisation is AGREE. Always agree and SAY YES.
> When you’re improvising, this means you are required to agree with
> whatever your partner has created. So if we’re improvising and I say,
> “Freeze, I have a gun,” and you say, “That’s not a gun. It’s your
> finger. You’re pointing your finger at me,” our improvised scene has
> ground to a halt. But if I say, “Freeze, I have a gun!” and you say,
> “The gun I gave you for Christmas! You bastard!” then we have started
> a scene because we have AGREED that my finger is in fact a Christmas
> gun. Now, obviously in real life you’re not always going to agree with
> everything everyone says. But the Rule of Agreement reminds you to
> “respect what your partner has created” and to at least start from an
> open-minded place. Start with a YES and see where that takes you.
