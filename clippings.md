description: Clippings from what I've been reading.

These are random highlights from books I've been reading. Using fmap's [clippings](https://github.com/fmap/clippings) library I wrote a small tool [clippings2md](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/clippings2md) to convert my Paperwhite's clippings to markdown and export that here.

### Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia

> And as I walk around this fog-asphyxiated Moscow, I see how the city’s
> topography articulates these splits: the bullying avenues with their
> baron-bureaucrats, bribes, and werewolves in uniform, where the only
> way to survive is to be as corrupt as they are, and just a few meters
> away the gentle courtyards with an almost bucolic mood and small-town
> ideas of decency. Before I used to think the two worlds were in
> conflict, but the truth is a symbiosis. It’s almost as if you are
> encouraged to have one identity one moment and the opposite one the
> next. So you’re always split into little bits and can never quite
> commit to changing things. And a result is the somewhat aggressive
> apathy you can encounter here so often. That’s the underlying mind-set
> that supported the USSR and supports the new Russia now even though
> the USSR might officially be long gone. But there is a great comfort
> in these splits, too: you can leave all your guilt with your “public”
> self. That wasn’t you stealing that budget/making that propaganda
> show/bending your knee to the President, just a role you were playing;
> you’re a good person really. It’s not so much about denial. It’s not
> even about suppressing dark secrets. You can see everything you do,
> all your sins. You just reorganize your emotional life so as not to
> care.

> On the tour of Skolkovo we were accompanied by a young man named
> Sergey Kalenik, a member of the Kremlin youth group, Nashi, created by
> Surkov. Sergey wore a hoodie, goatee, and skinny jeans and looked like
> any hipster youth you find in Brooklyn or Hackney—then he opened his
> mouth and began to sing paeans to the President and how the West is
> out to get Russia. Sergey was from a humble background in Minsk,
> Belarus. He first made his name by drawing a really rather good manga
> cartoon that showed the President as superhero doing battle against
> zombie protesters and evil monster anticorruption bloggers: a nice
> example of the Surkovian tactic of co-opting hipster language to its
> own ends, trying to get the “cool” people on the Kremlin’s side. The
> cartoon was so successful Kalenik was introduced to senior government
> officials, and his career as a young spin doctor was launched.
> “Politics is the ability to use any situation to advance your own
> status,” Sergey told me with a smile that seemed to mimic Surkov’s
> (who in turn mimics the KGB men). “How do you define your political
> views?” I asked him. He looked at me like I was a fool to ask, then
> smiled: “I’m a liberal . . . it can mean anything!”

> Now, Russia does have elections, but the “opposition,” with its almost

> “civil society” that is ever loyal to it. And though Russia does
> officially have a free market, with mega-corporations floating their
> record-breaking IPOs on the global stock exchanges, most of the owners
> are friends of the President. Or else they are oligarchs who
> officially pledge that everything that belongs to them is also the
> President’s when he needs it: “All that I have belongs to the state,”
> says Oleg Deripaska, one of the country’s richest men. This isn’t a

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The first fundamental distinction between classic style and
> contemplative style is thus that classic style presents something but
> contemplative style presents an interpretation of something. This
> entails many different decisions concerning truth, presentation, cast,
> and scene. The second fundamental distinction between classic style
> and contemplative style has to do with thought and language. Classic
> language is an instrument for presenting the product of thought
> according to the order of reason, not according to the sequence of
> experience. In contemplative style, writing is itself the engine of
> discovery: the writing is a record of the process of the writer’s
> thinking, quite independent of its relation to the order of reason. In
> contemplative style, the touchstone of the writing is the process of
> the writer’s contemplation.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Practical style comes from deciding that what matters in style is the
> reader, and in particular the reader’s ease in parsing features of the
> text, especially the discourse features of the text. Practical style
> is so firm in this decision that it treats it as no decision at all,
> but as a necessity: of course excellence of style consists in
> conforming to the reader’s grammatical expectations in the act of
> reading. Why else would anyone presume to take up a reader’s time than
> to solve a problem for the reader? Why then would anyone write except
> to inform the reader about a solution to that problem? How else can
> this be done aside from ordering the text so that readers can get the
> point before giving up in the face of the obvious difficulty? Williams
> and Colomb accordingly coach their students in a style of writing
> assimilated to a model of reading. Classic style makes similar
> pretenses in adopting the rather different stand that the writer
> counts equally with the reader, that both are fully engaged by the
> subject, competent, and alert, that of course the reader will be
> interested in what the writer has to say, and that of course the
> reader will recognize truth once it has been clearly presented.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic prose does not discuss doubts or fears about its own
> enterprise, not because it is naïve, but because it has chosen
> something incompatible with reflexive inquiry. We can question the
> possibility of acting or we can act, but we cannot do both at once.
> Classic writers make an unspoken choice: they act. Rather than discuss
> the possibility of action, they put that possibility to the test, and
> let the reader be the judge.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Plain style is communal, its model scene a congregation in which
> speakers reaffirm for each other common truths that are the property
> of all. In the theology behind plain style, truth is always simple,
> and it is a common human possession. Individual revisions of this
> communal possession distort and dilute it. The wisdom of children can
> be the wisdom of adults, because knowing truth requires no special
> experience and no critical analysis. Sophisticated thought and
> conceptual refinement pervert truth. Any language that reaches beyond
> the simplest level is suspicious as the probable symptom of such a
> perversion. Simple language may not always be completely adequate to
> the expression of truth, but at least it is pure as far as it goes.

### Even a Geek Can Speak: Low-Tech Presentation Skills for High-Tech People

> When people are nervous, sometimes the adrenaline can cause their

> In this image schema, the end of the sentence seems to be the goal of

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> In classic style, thinking is seeing, or more generally, recognizing;
> writing is presenting what the writer has seen so the reader can see
> it, too. The classic writer seems to be trying to place something
> before your eyes or trying to put you where he is so you can see what
> he sees.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> In the classic view, writing is not thinking. This runs counter to an
> extremely powerful and pervasive connection between a concept of
> writing and a concept of mind. Records are understood as a sort of
> external memory, and memory as internal records. Writing is thinking
> on paper, and thought is writing in the mind. The author’s mind is an
> endless paper on which he writes, making mind internal writing; and
> the book he writes is external mind, the external form of that
> writing. The author is the self thinking. The self is the author
> writing in the mind. (Hamlet says, “Within the book and volume of my
> brain.”) Sometimes, the self is an author who records the process of
> his thinking on paper.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> There is a tacit contract between writer and reader: the reader’s
> closely focused intelligence will be repaid with something valuable
> and self-contained.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The classic writer stands fully behind what she has to say because she
> has thought it out independently. It may be that in thinking something
> out independently she has come to a common conclusion, but in
> expressing it she is neither joining a chorus nor embracing a
> platitude. Her conclusion is the product of her own thought.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The elitism of classic style has nothing to do with the object of
> presentation, which can range from fine wines to deep sewer tunnels.
> It has nothing to do with the connoisseurship of the writer either.
> The writer may speak with a technical mastery not possessed by the
> reader, but his attitude is always that the reader lacks this mastery
> only accidentally. You could know what he knows, and you would if you
> were standing where he stands, which is where the classic writer is
> trying to place you.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Paradoxically, classic style thus requires a strong revelation of
> personality even as it subordinates what is merely personal. The
> classic writer is not interested in mirroring the personal processes
> of her thought; certainly she is not interested in mirroring her
> personal sensations or emotions. Yet, since her only motive for
> speaking is the felt importance of what she has to say, she reveals
> herself through the topics she chooses and what she says about them.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> When accuracy in the sense of being exhaustively correct involves
> complicated qualifications of no consequence to the main issue,
> classic writers do not hesitate to simplify. In this frame, accuracy
> becomes pedantry if it is indulged for its own sake. A classic writer
> will phrase a subordinate point precisely but without the promise that
> it is technically accurate. The convention between writer and reader
> is that the writer is not to be challenged on these points because
> they are merely scaffolding.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> But classic prose never has to be puzzled out. We never have to rework
> the expression in order to see what it means to present.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic writers speak with conviction. That conviction, they imply,
> comes from knowledge or experience of something that exists before the
> writing and is completely independent of it. Their prose is conceived
> of as a perfectly efficient instrument: it neither invents nor
> distorts.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The classic writer rarely writes as if he is pressing claims and
> presenting arguments, but rather pretends that he is presenting
> subjects and conducting analyses. When, on rare occasions, the classic
> writer adopts the stance that the reader will not believe what is
> being presented, he never concedes that the reader’s disposition
> should influence what he says. A writer who wishes to persuade is
> constrained from ever telling the audience something it is unwilling
> to believe, and this is a compromise unacceptable in the classic
> attitude. The classic attitude compels writers, in extreme cases, to
> express truth and leave the audience to its folly. In that case—as
> always—the writer’s explicit motive is not hope of persuasion but
> rather respect for truth. It is the choice Socrates makes in the
> Apology.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The classic writer presents himself not as a guide to morals or
> behavior, but as an observer of truth.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> In the classic view, what cannot be universally verified cannot be
> true.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> In classic style, opinions stated clearly and distinctly are treated
> as if they can be verified by simple observation. The writer does not
> typically attempt to persuade by argument. The writer merely puts the
> reader in a position to see whatever is being presented and suggests
> that the reader will be able to verify it because the style treats
> whatever conventions or even prejudices it operates from as if these
> were, like natural reason, shared by everyone. It is a style of
> disguised assertion.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic style expands the domain of truth to include anything that
> might require not merely the knowledge of a convention but even the
> ability to make a judgment.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic style treats external objects, contingent facts, and even
> opinions as if they too are beyond doubt or discussion. To verify them
> we need to acquire local conventions so widespread within the relevant
> culture that the style treats them as if they were natural endowments.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> His thesis is that everybody has what is essential for identifying
> truth—natural reason—whether or not that person has any special

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The elements come under five topical headings: truth, presentation,
> scene, cast, thought and language.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The domain of style is what can be chosen. A fundamental stand is a
> choice open to the writer. By contrast, to know a language is to know
> a great range of things that are not open to choice: it is not open to
> every writer, for example, to decide that sentences shall begin with a
> period and end with a capital letter, that the word “dog” shall refer
> to cats, that predicates shall not agree in number and person with
> their subjects, or that six fine brick houses shall be called “brick
> fine houses six.” You can, however, decide whether to call a certain
> dog a “dog” or a “hound,” to say “Sally devoured the roast beef”
> rather than “The roast beef was devoured by Sally,” to write in
> sentences that are short and clipped rather than baroque and periodic,
> or to write “24 March 1954” rather than “March 24, 1954,” but these
> are surface features. Books that talk about style in writing treat
> these moments of choice at the surface level but typically ignore the
> elements of style, which is to say, the fundamental choices from which
> surface features derive.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> If you start off with the view of style as a list of surface

 --- Asher, Joey

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The concept of classic style assumes that plain style already exists.
> The classic version introduces a refinement, a qualification, a
> meditation on the plain version that makes it classic. Classic style
> takes the attitude that it is superior to plain style because classic
> style presents intelligence as it should be presented: as a sparkling
> display, not weighed down by grinding earnestness.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> “The truth is pure and simple” is plain style. “The truth is rarely
> pure, and never simple” is classic style. The plain version contains
> many elements of classic style without being classic; the classic
> version contains all of the plain version without being plain.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> The role is severely limited because classic prose is pure, fearless,
> cool, and relentless. It asks no quarter and gives no quarter to
> anyone, including the writer. While the role can be necessary, true,
> and useful, as well as wonderfully thrilling, it can hardly be
> permanent. For better or worse, human beings are not pure, fearless,
> cool, or relentless, even if we may find it convenient for certain
> purposes to pretend that we are. The human condition does not, in
> general, allow the degree of autonomy and certainty that the classic
> writer pretends to have. It does not sustain the classic writer’s
> claim to disinterested expression of unconditional truth. It does not
> allow the writer indefinitely to maintain the posture required by
> classic style. But classic style simply does not acknowledge the human
> condition. The insouciance required to ignore what everyone knows and
> to carry the reader along in this style cannot be maintained very
> long, and the masters of the style always know its limits. The classic
> distance is a sprint.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic style is focused and assured. Its virtues are clarity and
> simplicity; in a sense, so are its vices. It declines to acknowledge
> ambiguities, unessential qualifications, doubts, or other styles. It
> declines to acknowledge that it is a style. It makes its hard choices
> silently and out of the reader’s sight. Once made, those hard choices
> are not acknowledged to be choices at all; they are presented as if
> they were inevitable because classic style is, above all, a style of
> presentation with claims to transparency.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose (Second Edition)

> Classic style is in its own view clear and simple as the truth. It
> adopts the stance that its purpose is presentation; its motive,
> disinterested truth. Successful presentation consists of aligning
> language with truth, and the test of this alignment is clarity and
> simplicity. The idea that presentation is successful when language is
> aligned with truth implies that truth can be known; truth needs no
> argument but only accurate presentation; the reader is competent to
> recognize truth; the symmetry between writer and reader allows the
> presentation to follow the model of conversation; a natural language
> is sufficient to express truth; and the writer knows the truth before
> he puts it into language.

 --- Thomas, Francis-Noël;Turner, Mark

### Marx

> Marx saw that within its own terms this defense of capitalism is
> coherent; but he also saw that from a broader, historical perspective,
> the liberal definition of freedom is open to a fundamental objection.
> To explain his objection, I shall switch to a more homely example.
> Suppose I live in the suburbs and work in the city. I could drive my
> car to work, or take the bus. I prefer not to wait around for the bus,
> and so I take my car. Fifty thousand other people living in my suburb
> face the same choice and make the same decision. The road to town is
> choked with cars. It takes each of us an hour to travel ten miles. In
> this situation, according to the liberal conception of freedom, we
> have all chosen freely. No one deliberately interfered with our
> choices. Yet the outcome is something none of us wants. If we all went
> by bus, the roads would be empty and we could cover the distance in
> twenty minutes. Even with the inconvenience of waiting at the bus
> stop, we would all prefer that. We are, of course, free to alter our
> choice of transportation, but what can we do? While so many cars slow
> the bus down, why should any individual choose differently? The
> liberal conception of freedom has led to a paradox: we have each
> chosen in our own interests, but the result is in no one’s interest.
> Individual rationality, collective irrationality.

 --- Singer, Peter

### Marx

> Everything Marx says about communism is premised on material
> abundance. Remember that it is the development of the forces of
> production that, according to the materialist theory of history, is
> the driving force behind historical change. The change from one form
> of society to another occurs when the existing structure of society
> acts as a fetter on the further development of the productive forces.
> But communism is the final form of society. Building on the dramatic
> advances so ruthlessly made by capitalism, communism allows the forces
> of production to develop to their fullest possible extent. Production
> will be cooperatively planned for the benefit of all, not wasted in
> socially fruitless competition between individual capitalists for
> their own private ends. There will be no crises of overproduction, as
> there are in unplanned economies. The reserve army of unemployed

> of the forces of production rather than the development of ideas. This
> did not mean that theory was unimportant. If Marx’s mission in life
> was to contribute to the overthrow of capitalism and the liberation of
> the proletariat, his theories of history and of economics were
> intended to do this by showing the workers their role in history and
> making them conscious of the manner in which capitalism exploited
> them. While theory could describe existing reality in this way,
> however, for theory to reach ahead of its time was another matter
> altogether. Marx derided as “Utopian” those socialists who sought to
> bring about communism by producing blueprints of a future communist
> society. His own form of socialism was, he claimed, scientific because
> it built on knowledge of the laws of history that would bring
> socialism into existence.

### Marx

> The view of society as a totality is no doubt illuminating when set
> against the view that ideas, politics, law, religion, and so on have a
> life and history of their own, independently of mundane economic
> matters. Nevertheless it does not amount to “the law of development of
> human history,” or to a scientific discovery comparable to Darwin’s
> theory of evolution. To qualify as a contribution to science, a
> proposed law must be precise enough to enable us to deduce from it
> certain consequences rather than others. That is how we test proposed
> scientific laws—by seeing if the consequences they predict actually
