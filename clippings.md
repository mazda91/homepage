# My Clippings

These are random highlights from books I've been reading. Using fmap's [clippings](https://github.com/fmap/clippings) library I wrote a small tool [clippings2md](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/clippings2md) to convert my Paperwhite's clippings to markdown and export that here.

> happened yesterday but which everyone swears won’t happen until
> tomorrow. —The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)

### Stand on Zanzibar

> Donald caught it before it hit the ground, turned it over in his hand
> as he stepped aside, and shot first the policeman and then Totilung to
> death. It’s the thing we know best how to do to a man. We’re
> marvellous at it, wonderful, unparalleled.

 --- John Brunner

### Stand on Zanzibar

> “This very distinguished philosophy professor came out on the platform
> in front of this gang of students and took a bit of chalk and scrawled
> up a proposition in symbolic logic on the board. He turned to the
> audience and said, ‘Well now, ladies and gentlemen, I think you’ll
> agree that that’s obvious?’ “Then he looked at it a bit more and
> started to scratch his head and after a while he said, ‘Excuse me!’
> And he disappeared. “About half an hour later he came back beaming all
> over his face and said triumphantly, ‘Yes, I was right—it is
> obvious!’”

 --- John Brunner

### Stand on Zanzibar

> Did nobody ever point out to you that the only liberty implied by free
> will is the opportunity to be wrong?

 --- John Brunner

### Stand on Zanzibar

> (LOGIC The principle governing human intellection. Its nature may be
> deduced from examining the two following propositions, both of which
> are held by human beings to be true and often by the same people: “I
> can’t so you mustn’t,” and “I can but you mustn’t.”

 --- John Brunner

### Stand on Zanzibar

> Every now and again there passes through his circuits a pulse which
> carries the cybernetic equivalent of the phrase, “Christ, what an
> imagination I’ve got.”

 --- John Brunner
