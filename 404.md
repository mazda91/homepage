# 404 Not Found

The requested document is no more.  \
'No file found.'  \
Even tried multi.  \
Nothing helped.  \
I'm really depressed about this.  \
You see, I'm just a web server...  \
-- here I am, brain the size of the universe,  \
trying to serve you a simple web page,  \
and then it doesn't even exist!  \
Where does that leave me?!  \
I mean, I don't even know you.  \
How should I know what you wanted from me?  \
You honestly think I can *guess*  \
what someone I don't even *know*  \
wants to find here?  \
*sigh*  \
Man, I'm so depressed I could just cry.  \
