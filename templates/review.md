# Reviews and Ratings

This is a sortable table of books I have read. I used Gwern's [goodReadsToMarkdown](http://www.gwern.net/haskell/goodreadsToMarkdown.hs) to compile this from the CSV export of [my goodreads account](http://www.goodreads.com/rejuvyesh) via [a ruby script I wrote](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/grab-goodreads-csv.rb).
