Me

Hi! I am Jayesh Kumar Gupta. I am a sophomore undergraduate at IIT Kanpur.

So how should I go about describing myself?

Judging by time within which I redesigned my website, I guess I am fairly narcisstic.

I am trying to start a blog sort of thing for quite some time.[^2] I think it as a much better way to share what I have been reading and thinking about. I think writing about stuff forces me to think harder, helping me to sharpen my thoughts, and improve my writing. I read plenty of books, papers, blogs and magazine articles and I hope this might help me improve my critical thinking.

I am really sheepish to accept this but I really don't play any video games. I have seldom found them more interesting or even fun, than a book.[^3]
