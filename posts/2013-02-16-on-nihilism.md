I have been interested in works by _Nietzsche_ since some time. Although I do have some issues with some of his views, I find myself agreeing with him at a number of points ^[Especially his sometimes cynical psychological insights]. So why was I interested in him? It all started with description of nihilism and how we currently live in such a society ^[I no longer remember the source. It was quite some time ago before I was interested in tracking and remembering where I got a certain idea.]. Here I will make a confession: I haven't really read any of his works completely. Somehow I had got an idea that _Nietzsche_ was a proponent of nihilism. But then I read [_The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162023.The_Cambridge_Companion_to_Nietzsche) and realized that I had it completely backwards. He did write a great deal on the topic, its true, but to only bring to light its effect on the society than to advocate it ^[nietzsche1].]. 

Since we don't wish to get into [disputing definitions]() let's define nihilism:

> A philosophical doctrine that all **values** are meaningless and nothing is knowable or communicable.

Just so that you might question _my_ definition][^words], see how a _Dictionary_ defines it ^[[Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nihilism)]:

> nihilism \ˈnī-(h)ə-ˌli-zəm, ˈnē-\: _noun_
>    a : a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and
>    that existence is senseless and useless
>    b : a doctrine that denies any objective ground of truth and especially of
>    moral truths

As you can see, my definition is not _that_ different. So back to my definition, I am mostly interested in the meaninglessness of **values** part. When all values are meaningless there are none which are more preferable than some other _i.e_ all values are relative. Which means that the idea, that all cultures and sets of values are equal, is in fact a component of nihilism.

Dawkins notes at the end of chapter 11 of _The Selfish Gene_,

We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism—something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.


[nietzsche1]: [Which is a little simplistic to say. After all he was a _philosopher_ <span data-icon="&#xe007;;" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#005580"></span>. Everything he says is not consistent. On the one hand, he regarded the "death of God" as being ultimately a _good_ thing for society, while in _Will to Power_ you can find the following comment where he is quite critical of rampant nihilsm: "Nihilism is…not only the belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough; one destroys."

[words]: "Saying "Words are arbitrary; I can define a word any way I like" makes around as much sense as driving a car over thin ice with the accelerator floored and saying, "Looking at this steering wheel, I can't see why one radial angle is special - so I can turn the steering wheel any way I like."" -_Eliezer Yudkowsky_.
