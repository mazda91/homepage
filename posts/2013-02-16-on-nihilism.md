I have been interested in works by _Nietzsche_ since some time. Although I do have some issues with some of his views, I find myself agreeing with him at a number of points ^[Especially his sometimes cynical psychological insights]. So why was I interested in him? It all started with description of nihilism and how we currently live in such a society ^[I no longer remember the source. It was quite some time ago before I was interested in tracking and remembering where I got a certain idea.]. Here I will make a confession: I haven't really read any of his works completely. Somehow I had got an idea that _Nietzsche_ was a proponent of nihilism. But then I read [_The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162023.The_Cambridge_Companion_to_Nietzsche) and realized that I had it completely backwards. He did write a great deal on the topic, its true, but to only bring to light its effect on the society than to advocate it [^nietzsche1].]. 

Since we don't wish to get into [disputing definitions](http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/) let's define nihilism:

> A philosophical doctrine that all **values** are meaningless and nothing is knowable or communicable.

Just so that you might question _my_ definition][^words], see how a _Dictionary_ defines it ^[[Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nihilism)]:

> **nihilism** (\\ˈnī-(h)ə-ˌli-zəm, ˈnē-\\): _noun_
>
>    a : a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and
>    that existence is senseless and useless
>
>    b : a doctrine that denies any objective ground of truth and especially of
>    moral truths

As you can see, my definition is not _that_ different. So back to my definition, I am mostly interested in the meaninglessness of **values** part. When all values are meaningless there are none which are more preferable than some other _i.e_ **all** values are relative. Which means that the idea, that all cultures and sets of values are equal, is in fact a component of nihilism!


## Beliefs and Values

Its important to be able to distinguish between beliefs and values. Here I use beliefs and values in the traditional way [^belief] [^value]. Basically I see beliefs as any conviction we hold to be "true", even without actual proof or evidence while values as things that I deem important. If I were to draw a relation:

~~~~~
    Belief --------> Fact **is**
    Value  --------> Behavior **should**
~~~~~
So nihilism should imply both value relativism and belief relativism. Right?

**Wrong**. Although value relativism, seems to be annoyingly true, belief relativism is just stupid. Just think of cultures like China where its appropriate to eat dog's meat as food, while elsewhere its not ^[Or just have a look at the controversy over beef in India.]. So, a value like one shouldn't eat cow/dog/...'s meat is something culturally set, and doesn't have to be the same everywhere.  Thus, all values _are_ baseless and the "universe imposes no values" ^[Which makes me a nihilist, I guess.]. [TODO add examples] But is it equally valid to believe that sun rises in the west instead of east? ^[Don't get into word mangling, defining west to be east and east to be west.] Could you cut your hand to see oil instead of blood? Would you jump of the roof and float in the air? **Of Course not!** If you hold such beliefs, then something is seriously wrong with you. Thus you can check beliefs against the benchmark of reality as valid or invalid (which science is all about and something we all should do).

But you might argue that there are beliefs that are hard or even impossible to check. You may be right, and I really don't have any counter-argument. Most of it usually falls into the realm of conspiracy theories ^[I know most of them are falsifiable, but still.], I can only ask why do you want to have a definite belief about an indefinite situation? Either way, I still believe that there is a _reality_, as an actual fact of our material existence. Why? Because even though you might not be able to check whether your great grandfather was left or right handed or where _is_ that particle whose momentum I just measured, the answers to these questions to exist. This only strengthens my belief that "words are not the reality".

Unfortunately for rational philosophy, values too should match reality. After all, while making decisions we also take our values into account. 

## Resolving the Contradiction

So if beliefs are not relative but values are and they both should model the same reality, we arrive at a contradiction. Or _do_ we?

First let's try to understand how these values are formed. I find the most plausible explanation to such phenomenon in the field of [evolutionary psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology). Evolutionary psychology sees every aspect of being a human through the lens of evolutionary adaptation. So we see that "survival" is something of primary value. Survival not of an individual or humanity but the genes. Similarly all local values are all just adaptations to the local milieu to increase "fitness". These values propagate in the form of "tribal memes" in the particular cultural tribe just like babies begin their process of individuation by first identifying with the family. This is the argument [Dawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) makes, in _The Selfish Gene_ and [Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wright_(journalist)) in _The Moral Animal_. I would recommend reading at least _the Selfish Gene_ for the full argument.

As Dawkins notes at the end of chapter 11 of _The Selfish Gene_, and I fully agree, that this doesn't mean that  survival of our genes _should_ be the goal:

> We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism—something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.

Doesn't it suspiciously sound like a fresh era of value creation like _Nietzche_ predicted?


[^belief]: Wikipedia defines it as "the psychological state in which an individual holds a proposition or premise to be true". Which is good enough for this discussion.

[^value]: Value in ethically "good" sense.

[^nietzsche1]: Which is a little simplistic to say. After all he was a _philosopher_ <span class="icon-wink" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#005580"></span>. Everything he says is not consistent. On the one hand, he regarded the "death of God" as being ultimately a _good_ thing for society, while in _Will to Power_ you can find the following comment where he is quite critical of rampant nihilism: "Nihilism is…not only the belief that everything deserves to perish; but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough; one destroys."

[^words]: > Saying "Words are arbitrary; I can define a word any way I like" makes around as much sense as driving a car over thin ice with the accelerator floored and saying, "Looking at this steering wheel, I can't see why one radial angle is special - so I can turn the steering wheel any way I like." -_Eliezer Yudkowsky_.
