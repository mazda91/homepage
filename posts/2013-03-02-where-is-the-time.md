Seriously, **where** is the time?

## Books

Lets start with books. A quick [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Number+of+books+) search pegs the number at around 129.9 million.
Mind you these are only the 2010 numbers. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year) tells us that at-least 2.2 million books are published every year.^[Which too is pretty old data]. You would say I anyway don't read any other books than those in English. You are right and some more calculation would show that at least half a million English language books are published every year. Which would result in at-least a quarter of all the books are in English, ^[I know we are approximating them on a lower side, considering most of the earlier printed books would be in English.]which is about 34 million books. If you don't realize how big this number is^[And trust me you can't because of [scope insensitivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect)] consider this: If you were to read 1 book per **minute**, it would take you about 65 years to complete all books that had been published until 2010.^[And you are not even sleeping or eating for a second or doing anything at all, other than _reading_ that damn book.] Would you even consider living like that?

But then you'll say that who the heck can read a book per minute any way. So this battle is lost any way. The best I can manage doing while doing everything else required to have some of "daily" social life would be one books a week ^[Which would really put me in a very rare percentile, if surveys are to be believed.]. Anyway we all have our favorite genres: some like fantasy, others science-fiction or mystery and horror and so on ^[We are only considering reading for "entertainment" and not other pursuits]. So let's just look at the science-fiction and fantasy(SF) genre and only its novels.^[Yeah right, my favorite.] Let's take only a 100 novels, nor any 100 SF novels, but the winners of the 2 most prestigious SF awards for the last 50 years: the [Hugo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20Award) and [Nebula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula%20Award) Awards. Reading this "vanishing small fraction" of one small ^[OK not so small.] fiction genre would take me ~2 years! Add another 4 or so years for the two runner ups, not to mention that the awards have multiple categories^[And the best works in SF are its short stories]. Even considering for [Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law) there exist more than a few thousand books which may be worth a read just in the SF genre [^sadfact]. But reading only SF is kind of claustrophobic. I also want to read some mysteries, manga and non-fiction! I better hurry up.

[^sadfact]: Another writer in [The Sad, Beautiful Fact That We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2011/04/21/135508305/the-sad-beautiful-fact-that-were-all-going-to-miss-almost-everything):

    > ... Let's say you read two a week, and sometimes you take on a long one that takes you a whole week. That's quite a brisk pace for the average person.  That lets you finish, let's say, 100 books a year. If we assume you start now, and you're 15, and you are willing to continue at this pace until you're 80. That's 6,500 books, which really sounds like a lot.\
    >  Let's do you another favor: Let's further assume you limit yourself to books from the last, say, 250 years. Nothing before 1761. This cuts out giant, enormous swaths of literature, of course, but we'll assume you're willing to write off thousands of years of writing in an effort to be reasonably well-read.\
    >  Of course, by the time you're 80, there will be 65 more years of new books, so by then, you're dealing with 315 years of books, which allows you to read about 20 books from each year. You'll have to break down your 20 books each year between fiction and nonfiction â€“ you have to cover history, philosophy, essays, diaries, science, religion, science fiction, westerns, political theory ... I hope you weren't planning to go out very much.\



## Music 

Now onto music. A visit to the largest music database in the world, [Gracenote](http://www.gracenote.com/), shows ~130 million tracks in the database. Considering some of them might be just different versions of the same song lets say it's listing around ~100 million unique songs. At-least around 25000 albums are released per year in US & Canada alone ^[This is a pretty low number considering this article: [Business Matters: 75,000 Albums Released In U.S. In 2010 -- Down 22% From 2009](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1179201/business-matters-75000-albums-released-in-us-in-2010-down-22-from-2009)]. Here I am not even considering that something like [Touhou Music]() exists ^[Which is >1.2 TB of songs: [Touhou lossless music collection](http://www.tlmc.eu/)]. The numbers are mind boggling and I am too depressed to calculate how many lifetimes worth of music is there.

## Movies and TV shows

So do you even have any time left for this? Well have you seen the [IMDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Movie%20Database)'s [Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top)? That's alone worth 2/3rd of a year ^[Watching one movie every day, after all you have other things to do as well. Right?]. IMDB too faddish for you? Have a look at _NY Times_' ["The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made"](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html) which would be another 3 years at a movie per day. And really, you are watching that stupid _Salman Khan_ movie again? You have to be kidding me!

TV shows! What TV shows? I don't any time left for watching those TV shows or a metric to compare their seasons upon seasons. I know I 'll be missing on art like _The Wire_ and _Breaking Bad_ but you'll have to cull something!

And please... don't get me started on anime.

And you seriously want me not to just remain a consumer of information but also a producer?
