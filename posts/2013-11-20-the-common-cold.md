![Dammit you common cold](/images/common-cold.jpg)

With another bout of cold just before the end-semester examinations and I wondered about the utter failure of both the human body as well as the pharmaceutical companies to find a solution.

> The Common Cold! The Common Cold! \
> The doctors really must be told \
> It's really time that they controlled \
> The horrors of the common cold. \

> I love the doctors — they are dears \
> But must they spend such years and years \
> Investigating such a lot Of illnesses which no one's got, \
> When everybody, young and old, \
> Is frantic with the common cold? \
> And I will eat my only hat \

Cold seems to have been a nuisance since early civilization, and it seems useless remedies for its treatment have been proposed since antiquity. For example, Hippocrates noted that bleeding was frequently used for treatment for colds.^[Useless of course. What? You thought that *would* work?] [^1982-rhinoviruses] 

[^1982-rhinoviruses]: Gwaltney Jr, Jack M. "Rhinoviruses." Viral infections of humans. Springer US, 1982. 491-517.

But then I realized that we already have a very good resistance to cold viruses. Seriously, when did you last hear someone dying of common cold? There is a reason why cold is considered a minor illness.

The reason we get repeated common cold seems to lies in the fact that the virus mutates extremely rapidly i.e. we're actually infected by different variant of virus everytime we develop immunity against another.
What's surprising (or not that surprising) is that all these variants cause the same symptoms. Mostly it's to do with the fact that all our nose can do is produce mucus and get inflamed :P.

The major virus responsible for most common colds are the rhinoviruses. More than 100 serotypes^[Distinct variations within a species of bacteria or viruses.] are known and they don't appear to share the [antigens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen) making it difficult to develop any universal treatment. Add to the fact that there are other viruses too^[Such as Coronavirus, Infuenza virus, Adenovirus etc. Besides, there are many which are still unknown.] causing the same symptoms that we know as "common cold". And from what I have read across the web, the prospects for development of a vaccine are very poor. Most papers that I came across showed null result[^2013-vaccine][^1972-rhino]. You might want to chant the cliche that "Prevention is better than cure". But in this case it appears that the only way this is possible is by long-term isolation from the community. Maybe you wanna hop on the next ship bound for Antarctica. ^[Yeah, right Antarctica. In case you wonder whether the cold climate would be suitable for cold prevention, I would remind you that cold weather doesn't cause common cold but seems to relatively increase the risk of infection]

One common thing I noticed in almost every paper was the lack of evidence for the use of antibiotics in the treatment of cold and called for cautious use of antibiotics[^2003-heikkinen][^2004-wat]. And the doctor here still prescribed me the same antibiotics as usual. If it weren't for the exams I wouldn't have gone to the clinic at all.

Anyway Scott Alexander's recent link [post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/11/17/more-links-for-november/) reminded me of something I always found quite intriguing. Almost all old people more than 100 years old are universally healthy. It's as if only people with stay-healthy-in-old-age genes seem to live long enough and others die off early. In the comments, Gwern gave quite a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon:

> Well, you have the phenomenon of compression of morbidity, where lifespans go up without extending the period where one is crippling and dying. And the risk of dying increases each year as bodies get more and more fragile and worn out. So perhaps there are no 110 year olds in terrible health because at 110 years old, if you get injured, you’re dead the next day. (And at age 110, the chance of surviving that year has dropped to something like 50%, so it’s not that implausible an interpretation…)

And yeah, sorry it's been a long time since I posted anything on this blog. Hopefully I will be more consistent now. (Got my own domain and all, in case you didn't notice the URL.)
