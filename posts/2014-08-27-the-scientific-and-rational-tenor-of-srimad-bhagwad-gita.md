Yeah right...

Well, this was the name of the talk being organized at IIT Kanpur all in the name of understanding "ancient" Indian "science". Interesting parts of the mail:

> The Holy Gita belongs to the whole of humanity. It is a logical and
> scientific exposition of ‘The Truth’.

> The Gita /interalia/ dwells on Karma-Yoga; Karma-Yoga is verily ‘the
> art and science’ as to how ‘any and all /Karma/’ can be raised to the
> level of /Dharma/; this indeed is amongst the foremost contributions of
> THE HOLY GITA. Indeed! this represents a **huge quantum leap** and puts THE
> HOLY GITA in an orbit all its own – in a territory uncharted by any
> philosophy or scripture at anytime and/or anywhere. 

The emphasis is mine. SMBC has me covered [here](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2628).

Yeah right...

And yes, we do have a "Bhakti Vedanta Club" as well at IIT Kanpur.

I am really fed up with people worshiping _Gita_ as the be all and all of all ethics and the "truth" as well as ancient Indian wisdom.

## What is wrong with you, Krishna?

First lets see the historical context in which the book was written. If you are the sort of person who thinks that _Mahabharata_ was not just a folklore, probably inspired by some old war around modern Delhi, constantly being rewritten and reimagined in oral transmission over the years by numerous bards, then I request you to stop reading any further as it will be a waste of time for both of us. Although I haven't read the _Mahabharata_ in its entirety, I personally find it a fabulous of epic about the dilemma of power and probably, the most harrowing of the ancient epics. And just like the Homeric epics, I find no reason, why _Mahabharata_ hasn't been reworked heavily over the years. My favorite aspect about _Mahabharata_ as a story is there is no single "party line" on any subject. Characters and their actions seldom remain black and white.

Mind you, I am no historian, but like all ancient epics which have a backing in oral tradition and have changed over the years, it is reasonable ^[I really can't find a source right now.] to believe that _Bhagwad Gita_ was added much later to the _Mahabharata_ canon. And the way it is framed as  a warrior prince's moral dilemma over war, hints that it was written in response to the rising Buddhism movement and Ashoka's turning away from war. The story can basically be summarized as Arjuna suffering from ethical dilemma over fighting his kins at the war and Krishna using various tactics to successfully convince Arjuna to fight. Arjuna's questions are extermely interesting and range from where his duty lies to how a restless mind can achieve lasting peace.

Eighteen days later, the war ends catastrophically; nearly everyone is dead. I am surprised, why Krishna's "wisdom" don't seem suspicious to most people and Arjuna seldom finds any sympathy for his initial doubts about the war? To me, _Mahabharata_ comes out decidedly anti-war, with no one actually "victorious". ^[Personally I find both _Mahabharata_ and _Ramayana_ extremely fascinating stories which remain quite ambivalent in their preaching. _Ramayana_ keeps itself open to reader interpretions, whether Ram was God or just the ideal human and how these concepts are connected. Never is it openly stated that Ram _is_ an incarnation of God. All this drama was later canonized by the all time best selling fan-fiction, _Ramcharitmanas_.]

I find four major take away points from the little second/third hand reading of Gita. One is to fulfill one's duty and fight, the whole concept of _dharma_. Second, detach oneself from the worldly and attain unity with the _Brahman_. Third, remain selfless in your endeavors. Fourth, devote yourself to the service of God. I am not a Gita literarist to quote verses but I'll try to give one example, how Krishna fails at each one of that. Let me know if I am wrong somewhere.

So the basic back story to the whole _Gita_ story is the war that Pandavas and Kauravas are fighting over some kingdom. So does Krishna say, that this is a "just war" and the earth's righteousness hangs in balance over it? Surprisingly, it is never elaborated why Arjuna's relatives are the most evil people on earth. Nowhere is the thorniest issue of the meaning of duty is even handled.

Next bending metaphysics to ones's own end, Krishna basically says since death is inevitable for the living, Arjuna need not grieve since all this is a part of a cyclical process. I really want to see this sort of argument made by a murderers lawyers in the court. Hopefully he/she will be sent to the lunatic asylum after that.

Then the whole self-less thingy. This seems reasonable, right? After what is wrong in performing your duties without any selfishness or attachment. But when you think a little about this, you'll see the self-help genius of Krishna. How slyly he removes the entire concept of outcome from ones "selfless acts." Why should a man of action consider anything silly as human impacts of ones actions. This is basically desensitizing a warrior to feel no remorse. And here we have our speaker explaining "how ‘any and all /Karma/’ can be raised to the
level of /Dharma/". Of course as we see, once cold blooded murder has already been "raised to the level of _Dharma_, any other _Karma_ need not fear being termed as _Adharma_.

Finally the whole worship thingy. Basically in the end, Krishna asks Arjun to trust him (God?) and fill his mind him, serve him, worship him -- you get the point. This ostensibly seems to imply that as long one has faith in Him, all sins are forgiven. This is where _Gita_ seems to leave any shred of rationality it might have had. I find Arjuna succumbing to this, an incredibly sad ending.

## What about other interpretations?

Of course, there are other interpretations, I don't deny them. After all it _is_ a literary text. But these interpretations are what the readers bring to the table, not the book itself. And if we are going to anyway interpret things we find useful and palatable to us, why _Gita_ then? If I want I can learn about these things from Game of Thrones ^[See <http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/23414/game-of-thrones-and-the-game-of-subtext> and <http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137360/charli-carpenter/game-of-thrones-as-theory> for examples.] and Harry Potter ^[See [Ultimate Harry Potter Philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/The-Ultimate-Harry-Potter-Philosophy/dp/0470398256) for example.] as well. Heck, there are _anime_ as deep as this. And they are the most derided of the artistic medium after video-games. So why the "holy" _Gita_, huh? Should I start calling Harry Potter "holy" as well?

## Is _Gita_ the only thing describing "ancient" Indian philosophy?

This is the problem. I don't know much of Indian philosophical tradition, but the [little](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/ancient-indian-philosophy-a-painless-introduction/) I have read, did convince me it was really good. How many people even know that atheism was actively embraced in the Hindu school of thought. Atheism and materialists were so common that Hindu scriptures from other schools found it necessary to respond to the arguments of non-believers. Heck, the materialist systems were called _Lokayata_ which literally means "that is found among people in general". One of my favorites, Carvaka, who has the Indian materialist school named after him, stated how soul is just the body manifesting intelligence and it had no existence outside the body. Nature is indifferent to good or evil. And who can forget the atheistic view points of _Jainism_ and _Buddhism_ ^[Never mind the later and current followers who just want something to worship.]. Mind you, these views coexisted in the milieu when _Gita_ was written. But do I ever see this being discussed anywhere?

_Gita_, set in a political setting, although written in the voice of God, one must remember was written by mortals only. And the singular lack of any critique of it, in the face of numerous conventions and talks being held, even at IIT-K, is extremely discomforting. I can only hope that these talks suffer from the same lack of audience as numerous other speakers face at IIT Kanpur.
