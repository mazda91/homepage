Being the kind of person who likes reading a lot, I guess I am the wrong person to ask this question; but still _why_ is reading (even fiction) seen as something better than watching TV. Everyone seems know that "smart" people read while "lazy" people watch TV^[Even when some who say they disagree with this stereotype don't have the two activities at an equal footing]. But aren't they often the same thing?

If I'm reading those massive volumes of [Game of Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones) and someone else is watching it on TV, what's the actual difference? Aren't we enjoying the same trope of  [Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism), with moral ambiguity very prevalent, few clear-cut heroes or villains and yet struggle triumphing. What's the difference between doing it through a book or television?

Why is it like that someone's considered superior because they're reading something, even if its as good as trash, simply because they are reading than watching television?

Maybe this is because we respect what fewer people do. After all reading takes some discipline and requires some skill like imagination to actually get immersed in the story telling, especially when the language gets difficult. Our mind needs to create a mental image of the characters, the locations, the events playing out the entire events we're reading. This requires a constant and active engagement. On the other hand, television, largely, seems to spoon-feed us, telling how each of the characters look like, the scene, the events; we just need to sit and soak it all - we don't really have to think.

Further, books tend to have more detail and depth in them than TV or movies ever have; a book might detail a scene, the emotions or the setting in two pages which television generally compresses in a few minutes. As a result, its generally accepted that a book will take longer to read than the resulting movie and if you have read the book, the film version will always leave you "wanting". Maybe, its not always true, but more often than not I'd wager^[Even though I haven't seen many movies.]. On an average books also tend to stay longer with you vs. an average TV series - the book will still have me thinking and churning over thoughts while only few television shows make me do that.

Another thing to consider is that reading is often confused with reading non-fiction. These are the people who are usually called "intellectuals". So perhaps all sorts of reading are simply being lumped together.

But is this a satisfactory explanation? I think we as humans like consuming stories; its difficult for me to make a clear cut distinction if one form is better.

I have read more fiction than non-fiction, watched some really good shows like [Breaking Bad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad), [Sherlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)) and [The Wire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_wire) and other run-of-the-mill TV series [while not forgetting a decent number of anime] which in the end make me the mix of thoughts and knowledge ^[or rather [memes](http://web.archive.org/web/20140202123609/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/02/ted_blackmore?currentPage=all)] I am, while giving me different perspectives. But more or less I have spent my leisure time reading rather than watching TV shows or movies, still prefer reading and believe that I am not deluded in my preference.
