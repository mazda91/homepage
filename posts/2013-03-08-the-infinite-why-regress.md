We all know what an infinite regress is. We all did it as a kid:

    > *<Insert any child here>*: Uncle, why do birds fly?
    > *<Insert some elder>*: They need to get food for their babies.
    > *C*: Why?
    > *E*: Baby birds are hungry. They'll starve.
    > *C*: Why?
    > *E*: Because they need energy to keep living.
    > *C*: Why?
    > .
    > .
    > .

This would go on until that person ran out of answers or lost patience and got fed-up, tired and would try to divert your attention. The truth is, if you think about it, even if a battery of biologists, physicists and chemists were assembled to answer the child's questioning, after some time none of them will be able to answer the "why" question.

This why regress is everywhere and Scientists know this^[citation needed]. First we introduced "atoms" to explain certain observations ^[See [Boltzmann's theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann#Physics)], and were _right_, even though they had **no idea** what could explain atoms _themselves_. Now we work with quarks even though we still have **no idea**what could explain the quarks and leptons^[See [Standard Model of Particle Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)] ^[Correct me if I am wrong and there is some explanation for them]. Explanations need not be understood themselves. Heck, a successful explanation might raise new puzzles and "present us with new questions". This is how science works. Period.

So I can't reproach myself enough to fall into the trap of Richard Dawkins's argument^[And is a fairly common objection put against _theism_] to explain the machinery of life:

    > "[...] by invoking a supernatural Designer is to explain precisely nothing." Why? Because it “leaves unexplained the origin of the designer.”

This is a classic "why" regress! This is nowhere close to being a strong objection against "God". If we started requiring all our explanations _must themselves be explained_, it would literally _destroy science_. If we required that a successful explanation must explain itself would immediately result in an infinite regress of explanations, with every explanation demanding an explanation of explanation, _ad infinitum_. We wouldn't be able to explain _anything_.

That's why the real objection against "God as an explanation" is not that a "theist" has no explanation for God but the low plausibility, poor consistency with background knowledge^[Which includes almost every commonly known scientific facts.], lack of simplicity^[See [Occam's Razor]()], untestability^[implying poor predictive values as well] and has almost no explanatory potential left^[Acting more or less as a semantic stop-sign _i.e_ we even stop thinking for alternatives after given this explanation]. Add to the fact, that it comes from a tradition (Supernaturalism) which has a terrible track record of extreme explanatory failure^[Just think of the countless things like rain and thunder, which were once considered as act of god (although some still do).].

Good scientific explanations, on the other hand are plausible, extremely testable while being consistent with background knowledge and most importantly are simpler. Not to forget the fact that no other tradition of thought has had more explanatory success than natural science.

Therefore, I sincerely apologize to everyone against whom I have used this argument^[Although I don't think there would be many. I don't really talk about such stuff to most people.].
