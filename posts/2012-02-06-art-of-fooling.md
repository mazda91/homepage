First things first. This is by no means a condemnation of The Art of Living policies or even the organisation per se, but my experience of meeting one of their representatives at IIT Kanpur, who by the way is  also an alumnus of IIT Kanpur.

It was nearly 11pm, someone knocked at our door asking us to come to the other double room in our wing. First response to such situation is why now?? But anyways I went there to see some senior sitting welcoming us. (This by the way is a little awkward at IIT-K, especially in first year). Let me call him Mr. M. What happened next would be a lifelong lesson for me at marketing. The reason he had decided to pay us a visit and being so humble and charming was to enroll us to Yes+, some initiative by The Art of Living. He talked about how joining this initiative was a life changing experience for him, while drawing from the general experience of an IIT student. He played on the fears of a typical IIT student, their anxiety of being the best while being restless over their aimlessness, their thoroughly ingrained _studyphobia_ (which is kind of institutionalized here at start). he talked about how the programme helped him overcome his fears, concentrate on his studies, get foreign internship (Every IITian's dream ;) ), relationship with parents and other cliché. Finally he was able to extract Rs. 2000 each from more than 10 students, just from our wing. But while other students went back to their rooms to fill the form and bring money, he started talking with one of my wing mates who it seems is suffering from some kind of joint disease. Whatever medicine he may take, no significant change is observable in his condition. So, he was suggested by Mr. M to join Yes+, and guaranteed assured relief. To which my roommate countered that he should better visit a psychiatrist as his personal experience showed that condition is more of a psychological product. Mr. M’s response to this was just _“Shut Up”_. This laid bare the actual state of Mr. M’s mind and aptly showed what he had learned at “The Art Of Living” and how he could manage to work full-time for the same organization.

All this has further strengthened my belief of never believing in any of the claims of any such, so-called personality development course and forced me think about the all-pervasive marketing strategies in today’s world. From [Roller Babies](http://youtu.be/XQcVllWpwGs) to Kolaveri di, this truly is the marketing age.
