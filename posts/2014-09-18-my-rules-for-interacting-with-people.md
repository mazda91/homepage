I've been reading Kahneman's _Thinking Fast and Slow_ and its chapter on how System 1 judges people by stereotypes and first impressions. Basically if feature F is associated with trait T, finding the feature F in a person incentivizes us to see trait T as well as other related traits T'. This correlation can sometimes run into a self-fulfilling and self-accelerating feedback loop. A good example is the [halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) due to a person's attractiveness. People perceived as being more attractive are more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and friendly. 

> **Rule 1**: Avoid making inferences about internal traits based on obvious features.

The other thing to keep in mind is that System 1 would anyway break this rule.

> **Rule 2**: Compensate for System 1.

Humans are complicated beings. It is easy to label certain people as evil when telling the story of our life. But one has to remember the world does not run on storybook rules. People have vastly different lives. Virtue is not always rewarded. This is not anybody's fault; just the way our world is.

> **Rule 3**: Remember your experiences are not indicative of other people's experiences. Humans are complicated beings.
