Was it a great year or a poor one? Let's look back.

## Studies

Bad. Really bad. Drove my CPI far below what I was aiming for. I console myself saying that I only have one semester to go, so I should stop worrying. But if I could tell my past self, I would only ask him to forgo some time from random internet articles to his courses. There are very few well defined benefits from reading online articles compared to course work.

## Travel

Finally got to travel by air, that too straight across to western hemisphere. :) . Fortunately I got a window seat while traveling from New Delhi to Abu Dhabi. Perhaps because I was a flight newbie and there were no babies crying across the aisle, I found the experience incredible. Seeing the shuddering wings of the airplane lifting its entire weight is enough to develop any cynic's faith in the human ability to overcome natural obstacles.

## Projects

![You decide](/images/automation.png ) 

1. [**hserv**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/hserv): Tried learning `haskell` by writing a simple `http` server using [`warp`](http://www.stackage.org/package/warp).

2. [**.emacs.d**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/emacs.d/): Refactored init into multiple files. Also started using [zkphi's `setup.el`](https://github.com/zk-phi/setup) for faster initialization. Although, I still need to work on portability issues.

3. [**Navya's Website**](http://navya.github.io/): Moved to a `hakyll` based setup.

4. [**poars**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/poars): Wrote a cludge to present OARS scraped data in the form of a table. This was soon deprecated in favor of [Srijan's](http://srijanshetty.in/) Angular [app](http://navya.github.io/oars/).

5. [**scrapoars**](https://github.com/navya/scrapoars): Cleaned up poars' scraper code into a separate program. This is right now the backend generating `json` for Srijan's [OARS](https://github.com/navya/oars).

6. [**PlanIt**](http://planit.cs.cornell.edu/): Extended algorithm to work with high dimensional robot hand movement. Cleaned up the website.

7. [**clippings2md**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/clippings2md): With [fmap's `clippings` library](https://github.com/fmap/clippings) and his enormous help, wrote a small haskell program to convert Kindle highlights to markdown. See [clippings](/clippings).

8. [**nix**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/nix): [fmap](https://github.com/fmap) and [muflax](https://github.com/muflax) provided me the impetus to try out [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/). I should stop being so lazy and move to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) completely.

9. [**arbtt-graph**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/arbtt-graph): I had been using [`arbtt`](http://arbtt.nomeata.de/#what) since the beginning of the year. [Karpathy's `ulogme`](https://github.com/karpathy/ulogme) prompted me to write a similar visualizer for `arbtt-stats`. Also, my daily laptop usage stats are [available](http://rejuvyesh.com/dailystats/).

10. [**paper-rename**](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/paper-rename): Wrote an academic paper rename utility to automate one more task.

11. Numerous scripts like [grabjeb](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/grabjeb.rb), [pdf2thumbs](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/pdf2thumbs), [pdf2wordcloud](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/pdf2thumbs), [cpbooks](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/cpbooks), [libg](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/libg) and [paper](https://github.com/rejuvyesh/Scripts/blob/master/paper). Replaced [lastpass](http://lastpass.com) with [pass](https://github.com/zx2c4/password-store).

## Links

Some of the interesting articles I read this year:

- [A Star in a Bottle](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/03/a-star-in-a-bottle?currentPage=all)

Great piece on fusion reactor ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor).

- [Hervé This: The world’s weirdest chef](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/herve-this-the-worlds-weirdest-chef)

Did you know there _is_ something like scientific discipline of molecular gastronomy?

- [The Death of Adulthood in American Culture](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/magazine/the-death-of-adulthood-in-american-culture.html)

> Meanwhile, television has made it very clear that we are at a frontier. Not only have shows like “The Sopranos” and “Mad Men” heralded the end of male authority; we’ve also witnessed the erosion of traditional adulthood in any form, at least as it used to be portrayed in the formerly tried-and-true genres of the urban cop show, the living-room or workplace sitcom and the prime-time soap opera. Instead, we are now in the age of “Girls,” “Broad City,” “Masters of Sex” (a prehistory of the end of patriarchy), “Bob’s Burgers” (a loopy post-"Simpsons” family cartoon) and a flood of goofy, sweet, self-indulgent and obnoxious improv-based web videos.

> Maybe nobody grows up anymore, but everyone gets older. What happens to the boy rebels when the dream of perpetual childhood fades and the traditional prerogatives of manhood are unavailable? There are two options: They become irrelevant or they turn into Louis C. K. (fig. 5). Every white American male under the age of 50 is some version of the character he plays on “Louie,” a show almost entirely devoted to the absurdity of being a pale, doughy heterosexual man with children in a post-patriarchal age. Or, if you prefer, a loser.

- [The Consequentalism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html)

> The basic thesis is that consequentialism is the only system which both satisfies our moral intuition that morality should make a difference to the real world, and that we should care about other people. Other moral systems are more concerned with looking good than being good, and although this is not immediately apparent it will hopefully become clearer on closer inspection.

- [Justin Timberlake Has a Cold](http://reprints.longform.org/justin-timberlake-has-a-cold). [`Mirror`](https://pdf.yt/d/_yi3gViOlBIqHo7j)

Fantastic reflection about the American music industry in general.

- [The Hedge Fund and the Despot](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-21/mugabes-bailout-och-ziff-investment-linked-to-zimbabwe-despot)

> McGee wouldn’t find out for years, but as the attacks were unfolding, and as he worked with Washington to financially isolate Mugabe, a Wall Street consortium provided the $100 million for the dictator’s government. These millions secured the rights to mine platinum, among the most valuable of minerals, from central Zimbabwe. Several firms were involved in the investment, including BlackRock (BLK), GLG Partners, and Credit Suisse (CS). The most vital player was Och-Ziff Capital Management (OZM), the largest publicly traded hedge fund on Wall Street. An Och-Ziff spokesman declined to comment for this article. Now some of its African investments are at the center of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

- [The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering](http://foundational-research.org/publications/importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/)

> Some feel that while humans have duties to treat well the animals that they use or live with, they have no responsibility to those outside their sphere of interaction. I find this unsatisfying; if we really care about animals because we don’t want fellow organisms to suffer brutally — not just because we want to “keep our moral house clean” — then it shouldn’t matter whether we have a personal connection with wild animals or not.

- [On Public Corruption in India](http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2011/09/on-public-corruption-in-india.html)

One of the most balanced studies of the Jan Lokpal movement.

> The JLP bill proposes to create a single independent agency to investigate allegations of public corruption all across India in accordance with the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. It'll incorporate the currently defanged anti-corruption units of existing agencies, like the CBI and CVC. The agency will have eleven appointed members, all "eminent individuals", chosen by a search and a selection committee. It will have lots of investigators and support staff. Investigators will have the powers vested in police officers, and will also be able to wiretap any suspect's phone and internet lines (utilizing a 2008 amendment to the Information Technology Act 2000, which, incidentally, has been criticized for lacking adequate "legal and procedural safeguards to prevent violation of civil liberties").

> Further, it's worth noting that this anti-corruption movement is not exactly an endorsement of the JLP bill itself—few of its supporters understand its details. It is more a howl against public corruption, fueled by the people's yearning for "judicial salvation" from a genuine problem and the government's atrocious response to peaceful protests. For all its commendable success in raising awareness and bravely forcing a major issue on the table, Team Anna has also tainted itself though its proximity, even if out of expedience, with Hindu nationalists and their symbols and slogans. Then there is Anna's very problematic leadership, illiberal politics, and authoritarian ways. This "simple man" and "Gandhian" figure has advocated chopping the hands of the corrupt, even hanging them, and has expressed support for executions on public squares. His views on Dalits in his village are retrograde (how much longer, I wonder, before he becomes a liability for Team Anna?).

- [George Wald: The Origin of Death](http://www.elijahwald.com/origin.html)

> The strange thing about all this is that we already have immortality, but in the wrong place. We have it in the germ plasm; we want it in the soma, in the body. We have fallen in love with the body. That’s that thing that looks back at us from the mirror. That’s the repository of that lovely identity that you keep chasing all your life. And as for that potentially immortal germ plasm, where that is one hundred years, one thousand years, ten thousand years hence, hardly interests us. I used to think that way, too, but I don’t any longer. You see, every creature alive on the earth today represents an unbroken line of life that stretches back to the first primitive organism to appear on this planet; and that is about three billion years. That really is immortality. For if that line of life had ever broken, how could we be here? All that time, our germ plasm has been living the life of those singlecelled creatures, the protozoa, reproducing by simple division, and occasionally going
through the process of syngamy -- the fusion of two cells to form one—in the act of sexual reproduction. All that time, that germ plasm has been making bodies and casting them off in the act of dying. If the germ plasm wants to swim in the ocean, it makes itself a fish; if the germ plasm wants to fly in the air, it makes itself a bird. If it wants to go to Harvard, it makes itself a man. The strangest thing of all is that the germ plasm that we carry around within us has done all those things. There was a time, hundreds of millions of years ago, when it was making fish. Then at a later time it was making amphibia, things like salamanders; and then at a still later time it was making reptiles. Then it made mammals, and now it’s making men. If we only have the restraint and good sense to leave it alone, heaven knows what it will make in ages to come. I, too, used to think that we had our immortality in the wrong place, but I don’t think so any longer. I think it’s in the right place. I think
that is the only kind of immortality worth having -- and we have it.

Doctors too want a peaceful death.

- [why I’m a crabby patty about AI and cognitive science](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2014/02/21/why-im-a-crabby-patty-about-ai-and-cognitive-science/)

> If that’s an exaggeration, it’s not much of one. Now it happens that this is a generally unhelpful way to think about technology. Technological progress is constant, but it is stunning how unevenly distributed it is. This leads to complaints of the type “they can put a man on the moon but they can’t make a deoderant that lasts past 2 PM.” This crops up in specific fields all the time. There’s been a well-documented problem in personal electronics where battery development has not kept pace with development in processors, leading to lower effective usage time thanks to the increased power requirement of faster processors. But you can extend this observation in all manner of directions, which is why futurism from the past is often so funny.

And my favorite part:

> C. Elegans is a nematode, a microscopic worm. It’s got something like 300 neurons. We know everything about it. We know everything about its anatomy. We know everything about its genome. We know everything about its neurology. We can perfectly control its environment. And we have no ability to predict its behavior. We simply do not know how  its brain works. But you can’t blame the people studying it; so much of the money and attention is sucked up by probabilistic approaches to cognitive science and artificial intelligence that there is a real lack of manpower and resources for solving a set of questions that are thousands of years old. You and me? We’ve got 80 billion neurons, and we don’t know what they’re really up to.

- [How the television news industry scripted the Indian elections](http://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/television-scripted)

> But what remains opaque is the cost of this media blitz. What was the trade-off between Modi and television networks? Was it the phantom of television rating points? Or was it a matter of ideology? There are no clear answers to these questions. Several factors appeared to have played a part to varying degrees.

> The irony is that all networks routinely talk about “deepening democracy” within the rarefied confines of the studio. But they seldom permit the creation of news content that will reflect the country’s unfolding diversity, especially visible during election time.

- [Nice Guys, Nice Social Justice](http://blog.jaibot.com/?p=346)

> Which is my main issue with the post – that it identifies the root node of the backlash against “nice guys” as something-like “evil in feminism”, when there’s a much more charitable explanation of a world where almost everyone was and is trying to do the right thing. If you step back and blur your vision a bit, it becomes really easy to tell a story where a lot of people really have and are experiencing a lot of real pain, coming up with explanations of varying accuracy, forming political coalitions based on those explanations, becoming deeply invested in those arguments, and everyone ends up in more pain as a result.
