It's been a long time since I posted something. Nothing substantial here, so you might as well skip it.

First the vacations. If you believe that there could be something more productive than preparing for the upcoming quizzes, then this vacation turned out to be immensely productive. On the one hand, I managed to complete six books (4 of them no-fiction) while surprisingly on the social front too it went quite well. I managed to talk an elder person (one of my friend's father) for more than two hours on a trot with topics ranging from whether Hinduism should even be considered a religion to how the same people who refuse to follow any rules here in India tend to follow every rule when out in _phoren_ land ^[It's been some time since the conversation happened and I have forgotten lot of stuff.]. This must surely be a new record for me, in terms of social interaction. To top it all I even had substantial talk with my parents (Something other than about myself. If you are so interested shoot me an email.) Not to forget I completed Season 1 of _The Wire_ and Season 2 of _Community_.

******

So, the books.

First one that I completed was **Dan Ariely's** _The Upside of Rationality_. If you are a follower of the [Less Wrong]() blog, you'll be left shouting different words for the same phenomenon. ^[For example on one of his chapters on how humans are bad at big numbers, I kept shouting (in my mind) [scope insensitivity]()] again and again.] So all in all, even though the book was well written, it didn't have much to offer to me personally. Yet if you are into rationality and stuff and don't believe in whiling your time reading random blog posts, I'd still recommend it ^[Not that you are asking for any, right?].

Next that I completed was **Lee Child's** _Killing Floor_. I would recommend against reading it as it completely failed for me as a mystery novel. Shouting at the protagonist for being so thickheaded to see what's so evident to yourself when less than half way through the novel is not my idea of a fun mystery novel.

Another fiction that I read was _The Colder War_, a novella by **Charles Stross**^[Available [here](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/colderwar.htm)]. It's a delightful SF take on the Cold War.

Now to the truly fantastic books I read/completed.

_Understanding Comics_ by **Scott McCloud**: I hardly used to read any comic except for those part of the newspaper syndication. Then I was introduced to the world of web-comics by [XKCD]() ^[An interesting article about web comics recently appeared in the Economist: [Triumph of the Nerds](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21568586-internet-has-unleashed-burst-cartooning-creativity-triumph-nerds)]. Even then it was like yeah cool stuff but none of them are long enough to tell a real story. But then I recently read the _Death Note_ Manga and _The Watchmen_ and I was like... **What???** I couldn't believe comics could be so great as a medium of story telling. This book forces you to think deeply about the characteristics, wholly unique to this art form. Two ideas that particularly struck me were "closure" - "phenomenon of observing the parts but perceiving the whole" and our preference for stylized characters rather than realistic ones.^[**McCloud** has explained it as how when you talk to someone else, you see their face in intimate detail; but your own face is just an abstract, stylized image in your head. Hence our identification with stylized, abstract faces.]
